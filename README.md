## **_MongoDB_**

+ MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas.

+ As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents. 
  
+ This format directly maps to native objects in most modern programming languages, making it a natural choice for developers, as they donâ€™t need to think about normalizing data. 
  
+ MongoDB can also handle high volume and can scale both vertically or horizontally to accommodate large data loads.

+ MongoDB was built for people building internet and business applications who need to evolve quickly and scale elegantly. Companies and development teams of all sizes use MongoDB for a wide variety of reasons.
